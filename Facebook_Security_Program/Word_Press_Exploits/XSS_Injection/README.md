## Pentesting Report

1. (Required) Authenticated stored cross-site scripting via image filename
  - [X] Summary: 
    - Vulnerability types: Insufficient validation 
    - Tested in version: 4.5.3
    - Fixed in version:4.6.1

  - [X] Steps to recreate: 
	create an image file name with cross-site scripting injected
	for example:
	cengizhansahinsumofpwn<img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>.jpg
	since the file name of an image is used as the image title in the attachment pages html, 	when we upload an image with an injected file name, we can pentrate the site, after waiting 	for an admin to upload the file
